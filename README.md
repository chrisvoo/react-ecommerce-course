 # Notes

 This is a create-react-app project taken from *[Complete React Developer in 2021 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/)*, but rewritten in Typescript. There are also some CSS differences and the file names or the project's structure is not the same.  
 The original project by Yihua Zhang can be found split in lessons  [on his GitHub's account](https://github.com/ZhangMYihua).

## Things to explore :checkered_flag:
